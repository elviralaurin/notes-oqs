# Fundamentals
On the following pages, we start off with the basics of quantum mechanics (QM). We will be a little loose with our definitions at first, but hopefully we'll be able to become more rigorous as we get a better understanding for what we're doing.

These notes are currently heavily based on the content of YouTube channel [Professor M does Science](https://youtube.com/@professormdoesscience?si=O8aiOL2qe5KsfWyH). If you prefer videos to text notes, I highly recommend their videos.
