# Measurement
The measurement of a quantum system and what happens to the system after a measurement has been done is at the core of the strangeness most people associate with quantum mechanics.

## Eigenstates and eigenvalues
Say you have a quantum system of some kind, and you want to measure one of its physical properties. That physical property corresponds to a particular Hermitian operator $\hat{A}$, and the result of you measuring this property of the system will be one of the **eigenvalues** of $\hat{A}$.

!!! info "Eigenstates and eigenvalues"
    Let $\hat{A}$ be an operator. The eigenstates $\ket{\lambda}$ and eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $\hat{A}$ are such that they obey:

    $$
    \hat{A}\ket{\lambda} = \lambda\ket{\lambda}.
    $$

    Note that $\ket{\lambda}$ is a **state vector**, while $\lambda$ is a **complex number**.

    In other words, the eigenstate
