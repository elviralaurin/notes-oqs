# About
These notes were originally written in preparation for my taking the course DD2366 Open Quantum Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, during the fall of 2024.

This is my attempt to understand quantum mechanics and open quantum systems (if such a thing can even be done). These notes are written in an effort to be pedagogical rather short and concise. As a result, they tend to get a bit wordy, so be warned.

Please note that I am writing these notes as I myself am learning the topic. I am no expert in any sense of the word.

All mistakes are my own. If you spot an error or disagree with anything, please leave a comment or a pull request in the [GitHub repository for this project](https://github.com/elviralaurin/notes-oqs).

**These notes are unfinished!** I will continuously be updating them as I learn.
