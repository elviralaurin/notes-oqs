# Introduction
These notes are my attempt to understand quantum mechanics and open quantum systems. They are written in an effort to be easily understood rather than condensed into a clean set of definitions and proofs. As a result, they tend to get a bit wordy, so be warned.

All mistakes are my own. If you spot an error or disagree with anything, please leave a comment or a pull request in the [GitHub repository for this project](https://github.com/elviralaurin/notes-oqs).
