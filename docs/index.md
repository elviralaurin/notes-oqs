# Introduction
These notes are my attempt to understand quantum mechanics and open quantum systems. They are written in an effort to be easily understood rather than condensed into a clean set of definitions and proofs. As a result, they tend to get a bit wordy, so be warned.

All mistakes are my own. If you spot an error or disagree with anything, please leave a comment or a pull request in the [GitHub repository for this project](https://github.com/elviralaurin/notes-oqs).
<!-- Let's try making a box.

!!! tip annotate "Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus (1)"

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, (2) consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et
    euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo
    purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. $a+b$

1.  :man_raising_hand: I'm an annotation!
2.  :woman_raising_hand: I'm an annotation as well! $a = b+c$

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit (1)
{ .annotate }

1.  :man_raising_hand: I'm an annotation! I can contain `code`, __formatted
    text__, images, ... basically anything that can be expressed in Markdown. -->
