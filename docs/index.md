# Introduction
These notes are my attempt to understand quantum mechanics and open quantum systems. They are written in an effort to be easily understood rather than condensed into a clean set of definitions and proofs(1). As a result, they tend to get a bit wordy, so be warned.

Please note that I am writing these notes as I myself am learning the topic. I am no expert in any sense of the word.

All mistakes are my own. If you spot an error or disagree with anything, please leave a comment or a pull request in the [GitHub repository for this project](https://github.com/elviralaurin/notes-oqs).
