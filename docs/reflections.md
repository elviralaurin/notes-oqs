When learning (or teaching) a topic as complex as quantum mechanics, where do you even start?

If you like to be rigorous, like me, then you would reasonably have to start off with abstract linear algebra and statistical mechanics. But how much of that is relevant then? Where does one topic end and another begin? How do you avoid getting stuck in the details of the underlying formalities?

If your foundations are weak, which I find mine to be to some extent(1), it sometimes feels as if your only option is to go back and relearn them entirely, to find and cover up the holes in your knowledge. But time is most often limited, so that might not be an option.

1.    At this point it has been some time since my linear algebra and statistics courses, and while I have had and passed several courses after that which could be somewhat reductionistically summarized as "applied linear algebra", the area has felt pretty murky everytime I've had to deal with it. I guess that's uni life though: you have enough time to memorize enough to pass the test, but not enough time to understand the topic deeply. Maybe that pattern is what I'm trying to escape by making these notes?

In that case, it seems like there are some facts in this new topic that you're going to have to accept at face value.

What is a Hilbert space? &ndash; It's a special kind of vector space where state vectors live. What is a state vector? &ndash; It's something that represents the state of a physical system.

That's not very rigorous, and I really, really dislike starting off like that. But maybe that's just a pill we'll have to swallow right now. It's actually surprisingly hard to even find the "correct", formal answers to the questions above.

What is a Hilbert space? Some sources say it's simply a complex vector space that can be infinite-dimensional. Others say something along the lines of it being a complete metric space equipped with an inner product, or that it is the $L^2$ space, or that it has to be separable, etc, etc, etc.

These descriptions are all probably correct. They also probably overlap quite a bit in ways that I don't have the ability to recognize yet.

To a newbie in the topic, this is extremely confusing though, and can be quite frustrating. My hope is that I will be able to accept things at face value at first, and that as I go along, I'll be able to get a more and more refined sense of what it all means. Maybe I'll be able to realize halfway through how to improve the introduction of the fundamentals in a way that doesn't feel quite as handwavy.
